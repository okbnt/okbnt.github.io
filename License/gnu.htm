reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the<br> 
Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any<br> 
greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further<br> 
Modifications or combinations<br> 
<br> 
3. Distribution Obligations.
<br> 
3.1. Application of License.<br> 
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br> 
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br> 
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br> 
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future<br> 
version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must<br> 
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code<br> 
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source<br> 
Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of<br> 
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may<br> 
include an additional document offering the additional rights<br> 
described in Section 3.5.<br> 
<br> 
3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br> 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must<br> 
be made available, prior to any use, except for internal<br> 
development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of<br> 
this License either on the same media as an Executable version or<br> 
via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom<br> 
you made an Executable version available; and if made available via<br> 
Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at<br> 
least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became<br> 
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of<br> 
that particular Modification has been made available to such<br> 
recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the<br> 
Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact<br> 
means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial<br> 
Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may<br> 
provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification<br> 
to be made available.<br> 
<br> 
3.3. Description of Modifications.<br> 
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain<br> 
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code<br> 
and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement<br> 
that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from<br> 
Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the<br> 
name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in<br> 
any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in<br> 
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br> 
<br> 
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br> 
<br> 
(a) Third Party Claims.<br> 
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual<br> 
property right in particular functionality or code (or its<br> 
utilization under this License), you must include a text<br> 
file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which<br> 
describes the claim and the party making the claim in<br> 
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to<br> 
contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your<br> 
Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You<br> 
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make<br> 
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as<br> 
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)<br> 
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the<br> 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br> 
<br> 
(b) Representations.<br> 
<br> 
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br> 
Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that<br> 
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original<br> 
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to<br> 
grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br> 
<br> 
3.5. Required Notices.<br> 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the<br> 
Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source<br> 
Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered<br> 
Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your<br> 
name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it<br> 
is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file<br> 
due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a<br> 
location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be<br> 
likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to<br> 
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br> 
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br> 
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br> 
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear<br> 
that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation<br> 
is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the<br> 
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred<br> 
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<br> 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br> 
<br> 
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br> 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br> 
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered<br> 
Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code<br> 
version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this<br> 
License, including a description of how and where You have<br> 
fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be<br> 
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,<br> 
related documentation or collateral in which You describe<br> 
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute<br> 
the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your<br> 
choice, which may contain terms different from this License,<br> 
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License<br> 
and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to<br> 
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version<br> 
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the<br> 
Executable version under a different license You must make it<br> 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are<br> 
offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any<br> 
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer<br> 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br> 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You<br> 
offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered<br> 
Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the<br> 
documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.<br> 
<br> 
3.7. Larger Works.<br> 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other<br> 
code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the<br> 
Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure<br> 
the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered<br> 
Code.<br> 
<br> 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
<br> 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br> 
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br> 
statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of<br> 
this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of<br> 
the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully<br> 
with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they<br> 
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file<br> 
described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all<br> 
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited<br> 
by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently<br> 
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand<br> 
it.<br> 
<br> 
5. Application of this License.
<br> 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br> 
attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.<br> 
<br> 
6. Versions of the License.
<br> 
6.1. New Versions.<br> 
License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the<br> 
License from time to time. Each version will be given a<br> 
distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to<br> 
opensource.org for certification.<br> 
<br> 
6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br> 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of<br> 
the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of<br> 
that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under<br> 
the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by<br> 
Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the<br> 
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under<br> 
this License.<br> 
<br> 
6.3. Derivative Works.<br> 
If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in<br> 
association with the required Developer Specific License described<br> 
in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code<br> 
which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you<br> 
must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'',<br> 
``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear<br> 
anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your<br> 
version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open<br> 
Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,<br> 
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A<br> 
shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this<br> 
License.)<br> 
<br> 
6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License<br> 
<br> 
This license is a union of the following two parts that should be<br> 
found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of<br> 
preeminence:<br> 
<br> 
[1] A Developer specific license.<br> 
<br> 
[2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general<br> 
licensing policy of the software.<br> 
<br> 
In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license,<br> 
the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by<br> 
the terms of the higher numbered part.<br> 
<br> 
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
<br> 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,<br> 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br> 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br> 
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR<br> 
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF<br> 
THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE<br> 
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER<br> 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR<br> 
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART<br> 
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER<br> 
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br> 
<br> 
8. TERMINATION.
<br> 
8.1 Termination upon Breach<br> 
<br> 
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br> 
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br> 
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br> 
sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall<br> 
survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their<br> 
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br> 
shall survive.<br> 
<br> 
8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by<br> 
asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment<br> 
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial<br> 
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred<br> 
to as "Participant") alleging that:<br> 
<br> 
(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or<br> 
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights<br> 
granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or<br> 
2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant<br> 
terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt<br> 
of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a<br> 
mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future<br> 
use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw<br> 
Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version<br> 
against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a<br> 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually<br> 
agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br> 
is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You<br> 
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the<br> 
expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.<br> 
<br> 
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such<br> 
Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly<br> 
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such<br> 
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked<br> 
effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,<br> 
distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br> 
Participant.<br> 
<br> 
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br> 
alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or<br> 
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br> 
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br> 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br> 
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br> 
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br> 
license.<br> 
<br> 
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all<br> 
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br> 
which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br> 
prior to termination shall survive termination.<br> 
<br> 
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<br> 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br> 
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL<br> 
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br> 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER<br> 
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br> 
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF<br> 
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND<br> 
ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE<br> 
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br> 
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br> 
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br> 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br> 
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br> 
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br> 
<br> 
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
<br> 
The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in<br> 
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer<br> 
software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such<br> 
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br> 
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br> 
all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br> 
rights set forth herein.<br> 
<br> 
11. MISCELLANEOUS.
<br> 
This section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this<br> 
section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.<br> 
<br> 
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
<br> 
Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with<br> 
Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or<br> 
indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License,<br> 
based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the<br> 
revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant<br> 
factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with<br> 
Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.<br>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br> 
<br> 
0. PREAMBLE<br> 
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other <br> 
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure <br> 
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or <br> 
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, <br> 
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit <br> 
for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications <br> 
made by others.<br> 
<br> 
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of <br> 
the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the <br>
GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.<br> 
<br> 
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, <br> 
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come <br> 
with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this <br> 
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual <br> 
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. <br> 
We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.<br> 
<br> 
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<br> 
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains <br> 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the <br> 
terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, <br> 
unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. <br> 
The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the <br> 
public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if <br> 
you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under <br> 
copyright law.<br> 
<br> 
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document <br> 
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated <br> 
into another language.<br> 
<br> 
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document <br> 
that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document <br> 
to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could <br> 
fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook <br> 
of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship <br> 
could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or <br> 
of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.<br> 
<br> 
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as <br> 
being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released <br> 
under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it <br> 
is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant <br> 
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.<br> 
<br> 
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as <br> 
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the <br> 
Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at <br> 
most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.<br> 
<br> 
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented <br> 
in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is <br> 
suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors <br> 
or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) <br> 
some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to <br> 
text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable <br> 
for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file <br> 
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or <br> 
discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image <br> 
format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. <br> 
A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".<br> 
<br> 
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII <br> 
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML <br> 
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript <br> 
or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image <br> 
formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats <br> 
that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML <br> 
for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and <br> 
the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors <br> 
for output purposes only.<br> 
<br> 
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such <br> 
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License <br> 
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have <br> 
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent <br> 
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.<br> 
<br> 
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the <br> 
Document to the public.<br> 
<br> 
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title <br> 
either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that <br> 
translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section <br> 
name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", <br> 
or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the <br> 
Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.<br> 
<br> 
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which <br> 
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers <br> 
are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards <br> 
disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers <br> 
may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.<br> 
<br> 
2. VERBATIM COPYING<br> 
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially <br> 
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and <br> 
the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced <br> 
in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of <br> 
this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the <br> 
reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you <br> 
may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large <br> 
enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.<br> 
<br> 
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you <br> 
may publicly display copies.<br> 
<br> 
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<br> 
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) <br> 
of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires <br> 
Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, <br> 
all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover <br> 
Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify <br> 
you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full <br> 
title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may <br> 
add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to <br> 
the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy <br> 
these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.<br> 
<br> 
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you <br> 
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual <br> 
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.<br> 
<br> 
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more <br> 
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along <br> 
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network <br> 
location from which the general network-using public has access to download <br> 
using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the <br> 
Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take <br> 
reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in <br> 
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible <br> 
at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you <br> 
distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) <br> 
of that edition to the public.<br> 
<br> 
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document <br> 
well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance <br> 
to provide you with an updated version of the Document.<br> 
<br> 
4. MODIFICATIONS<br> 
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the <br> 
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified <br> 
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling <br> 
the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of <br> 
the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you <br> 
must do these things in the Modified Version:<br> 
<br> 
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from <br> 
that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, <br> 
if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). <br> 
You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher <br> 
of that version gives permission.<br> 
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities <br> 
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, <br> 
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document <br> 
(all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they <br> 
release you from this requirement.<br> 
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified <br> 
Version, as the publisher.<br> 
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<br> 
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent <br> 
to the other copyright notices.<br> 
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice <br> 
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms <br> 
of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.<br> 
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections <br> 
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.<br> 
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.<br> 
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add <br> 
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher <br> 
of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section <br> 
Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, <br> 
authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then <br> 
add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.<br> 
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public <br> 
access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network <br> 
locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. <br> 
These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location <br> 
for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, <br> 
or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.<br> 
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve <br> 
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and <br> 
tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.<br> 
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their <br> 
text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not <br> 
considered part of the section titles.<br> 
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may <br> 
not be included in the Modified Version.<br> 
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" <br> 
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.<br> 
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.<br> 
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that <br> 
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, <br> 
you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. <br> 
To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the <br> 
Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.<br> 
<br> 
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing <br> 
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, <br> 
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization <br> 
as the authoritative definition of a standard.<br> 
<br> 
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage <br> 
of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the <br> 
Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover <br> 
Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document <br> 
already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by <br> 
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; <br> 
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.<br> 
<br> 
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License <br> 
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or <br> 
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.<br> 
<br> 
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS<br> 
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, <br> 
under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that <br> 
you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all <br> 
of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant <br> 
Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you <br> 
preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.<br> 
<br> 
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple <br> 
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are <br> 
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make <br> 
the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, <br> 
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, <br> 
or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles <br> 
in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.<br> 
<br> 
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" <br> 
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; <br> 
likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", <br> 
and any sections Entitled "Dedications". <br> 
You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".<br> 
<br> 
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<br> 
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents <br> 
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License <br> 
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, <br> 
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of <br> 
each of the documents in all other respects.<br> 
<br> 
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it <br> 
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License <br> 
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects <br> 
regarding verbatim copying of that document.<br> 
<br> 
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<br> 
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and <br> 
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution <br> 
medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation <br> 
is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the <br> 
individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this <br> 
License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not <br> 
themselves derivative works of the Document.<br> 
<br> 
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, <br> 
then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's <br> 
Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, <br> 
or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. <br> 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.<br> 
<br> 
8. TRANSLATION<br> 
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations <br> 
of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with <br> 
translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you <br> 
may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the <br> 
original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation <br> 
of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty <br> 
Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this <br> 
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a <br> 
disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or <br> 
a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.<br> 
<br> 
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", <br> 
or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) <br> 
will typically require changing the actual title.<br> 
<br> 
9. TERMINATION<br> 
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as <br> 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, <br> 
sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate <br> 
your rights under this License.<br> 
<br> 
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a <br> 
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until <br> 
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, <br> 
if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some <br> 
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br> 
<br> 
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated <br> 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some <br> 
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation <br> 
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the <br> 
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.<br> 
<br> 
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses <br> 
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. <br> 
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt <br> 
of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.<br> 
<br> 
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<br> 
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the <br> 
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will <br> 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail <br> 
to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.<br> 
<br> 
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. <br> 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License <br> 
"or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms <br> 
and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that <br> 
has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. <br> 
If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may <br> 
choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. <br> 
If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this <br> 
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version <br> 
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.<br> 
<br> 
11. RELICENSING<br> 
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any <br> 
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also <br> 
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. <br> 
A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. <br> 
A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the <br> 
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.<br> 
<br> 
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 <br> 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit <br> 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, <br> 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license <br> 
published by that same organization.<br> 
<br> 
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, <br> 
in whole or in part, as part of another Document.<br> 
<br> 
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, <br> 
and if all works that were first published under this License <br> 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated <br> 
in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts <br> 
or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.<br> 
<br> 
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained <br> 
in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before <br> 
August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.<br> <br>
